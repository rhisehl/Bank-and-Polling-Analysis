# Python Challenge: PyBank and PyPoll

PyBank: Conducted an analysis of a business's monthly profits and losses spanning several years. Determined the change over time of profits and losses, as well as the months showing the greatest increases and decreases in profits (August 2016 and February 2014, respectively). On average, the business's profits decreased by $8,311.11 per month. 


PyPoll: Took raw voting results and determined the winner of the election. By manipulating the data, the total number of votes were determined, as well as a list of all candidates with votes. After that, the total number of votes per candidate and percentage of total votes were determined. This led to the final result of Diana DeGette winning the election with 73.812% of the votes.
